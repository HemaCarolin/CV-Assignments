# CSc 8830: Computer Vision : Assignment 1 Solutions
## Question 1

To calibrate the camera, I have used a 8x6 checkerboard pattern. 

The code to take 10 images of the checker board using both the monochrome (left and right) and color cameras can be found in the file ques1.ipynb
The images captured can found in the folder 'images'.

The images are then used for calculating the camera matrix, translation and rotational vectors.

The corrected images are found in the 'images' folder and the corresponding camera values are stored in their respective folders (left, right and color).
